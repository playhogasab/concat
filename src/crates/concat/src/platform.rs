//! What the window asks of the platform it runs on.
//!
//! Four things differ between a desk and a phone: how the backend is
//! chosen, how a file or folder is picked, whether the window has a title
//! strip of its own to drag, and whether a file dragged in from outside the
//! window is even a thing that can happen. Everything else in the crate is
//! the same tree, the same state and the same callbacks, so the differences
//! live here and nowhere else.
//!
//! Desktop and iOS draw through the winit backend; Android through Slint's
//! android-activity backend, which the activity sets up before [`crate::run`]
//! is called. File dialogs are the desktop's: on a phone a pick goes through
//! the system's document picker, which arrives with the phone layout. A drag
//! in from the OS is a desktop thing for the same reason: winit reports
//! `DroppedFile` on macOS, Windows and X11, and not on iOS, which has no
//! such gesture - nor on Wayland, where the window listens for the drop
//! itself; see [`crate::wayland_drop`].

/// Dropped files. winit reports one path per event, in a burst, and the
/// burst is over when the loop is about to wait, so the paths are held
/// and handed over together: one probe, one notice, however many files.
/// On Wayland winit reports nothing, and the window's own listener puts
/// the paths of a drop in `arrived` from its thread and wakes the loop,
/// which hands them over the same way.
///
/// A press away from the field being typed into. Slint keeps the focus
/// where it is until something else takes it, so a number field stayed in
/// its editing state - ring and all - through a click on a clip, a knob or
/// the monitor. Every press now passes through here first: if a text input
/// has the focus and the press is not on it, the window is asked to take
/// the focus back (App.blur) before Slint routes the press, and whatever
/// was pressed then takes the focus itself if it wants it - another input
/// does, so a click from one field into the next still lands a caret.
///
/// And on Linux, the window's edges. X11 and Wayland take the resize
/// borders away with the decorations, where Windows keeps them, so a
/// press within a few pixels of the frame is handed to the window manager
/// as a resize (winit's `drag_resize_window`) before Slint sees it, and

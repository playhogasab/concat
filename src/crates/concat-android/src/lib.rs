//! The activity's entry point. android-activity calls `android_main` on
//! its own thread once the activity is up; Slint's backend takes the
//! activity from there, and the window runs exactly as it does anywhere
//! else.
//!
//! Two things are settled here before the window starts, because only the
//! activity knows them. The app's directories: an Android process has no
//! home directory, so the host's XDG bases are pointed at the app's own
//! files folder, and its external files folder stands in for the home the
//! project and export defaults hang off. And where words go: a process on
//! a phone has no terminal, so the log facade and everything the window
//! prints to stderr are forwarded to logcat under the `concat` tag, which
//! is where `adb logcat -s concat` reads a report from.
